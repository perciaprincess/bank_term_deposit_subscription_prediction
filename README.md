# 🏦 Bank Term Deposit Subscription Prediction

This project predicts whether a bank customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on demographic, financial, and campaign-related features.  
The solution includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, multiple ML models, SHAP explainability, and a Streamlit web app deployment.

## 🚀 Features
- Cleaned & preprocessed dataset
- Machine learning pipeline (without data leakage)
- Model comparison (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, LightGBM, etc.)
- SHAP explainability for feature importance
- Interactive **Streamlit web application** for live predictions
- Deployment-ready (Streamlit Cloud / AWS EC2)

## 🧠 Best Performing Model
**LightGBM (LGBMClassifier)** with highest ROC-AUC score.

## 🌐 Live Application
